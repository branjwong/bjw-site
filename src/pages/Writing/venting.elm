Venting
=======
July-02-12: 11:44pm
-------------------
Usually I'm not the type to go blabbing about my problems to all my friends, but lately I've felt the need to vent a lot. Recently, I've felt the need to enlighten most of my close friends about the shit-show that is my current relationship standing with my father. I mean, I just did it to my cousin five minutes ago. Perhaps this is a better place to vent though. Sure, it's the internet, and sure, everyone can access it, but I want to learn HTML and webdesign anyway; I can kill two birds with one stone. And honestly, if you're this interested in my personal life to come to this site (if you can even call it that, I mean I'm currently running this off Dropbox,) by all means, listen.
